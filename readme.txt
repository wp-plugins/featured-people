Once the length of the “Bio” is longer than 120 characters, the plugin finds where there is a period and cuts it off into a paragraph. It then uses the animated collapse to do a dropdown of the rest of the bio.  Read More/Less is then displayed to drop down the info, and if someone doesn’t have a link for their name their name also starts the dropdown.
